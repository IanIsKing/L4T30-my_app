Welcome to the GitHub API.

Simply type a userâ€™s name in the search box and press enter. It will then search GitHub for users closest to this username and provide 30 results.
The user can then select a result to see more information on that person and can also select any of their repos to see the commit details on this repo.

Please note there are only 60 API calls allowed per hour.

To start the project fork a copy,
Install dependancies for both front end and back end - npm install,
Run - npm start. Front and and back end.

Enjoy.

Testing

3 seperate tests will test the rendering of the front end, one will do a API call from the front end to the back end to GitHib API and ensure 30 results are returned.
Ive also included 3 tests on the backend.
